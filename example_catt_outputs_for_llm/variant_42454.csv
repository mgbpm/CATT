42454,Uncertain significance,"Mar 31, 2022","Curated 19/3/2021: Based on the classification scheme VCGS_Germline_v1.3.4, this variant is classified as VUS - 3A. Following criteria are met: 0103 - Dominant negative and loss of function are known mechanisms of disease in this gene and are associated with Fabry disease (MIM#301500). Truncating variants in the last exon have been reported with a dominant negative mechanism, while those predicted to undergo nonsense mediated decay been reported with a loss of function mechanism. Missense variants have been reported with both aforementioned mechanisms. Gain of function has also been suggested, however more evidence is required (PMID: 8878432; PMID: 31613176). (I) 0109 - This gene is associated with X-linked disease. Both males and females have been reported with Fabry disease, though the latter are more rarely reported and tend to have milder disease (OMIM, PMID: 31613176). (I) 0200 - Variant is predicted to result in a missense amino acid change from arginine to cysteine. (I) 0251 - This variant is heterozygous. (I) 0302 - Variant is present in gnomAD (v3) <0.001 for a dominant condition (30 heterozygotes, 1 homozygote, 13 hemizygotes). (SP) 0309 - An alternative amino acid change at the same position has been observed in gnomAD (v3) (4 heterozygotes, 0 homozygotes, 1 hemizygote). (I) 0501 - Missense variant consistently predicted to be damaging by multiple in silico tools or highly conserved with a major amino acid change. (SP) 0600 - Variant is located in the annotated melibiase 2 domain (Pfam). (I) 0701 - Another missense variant comparable to the one identified in this case has inconclusive previous evidence for pathogenicity. p.(Arg118His) has previously been reported as a VUS in at least one publication (PMID 30477121). Alternative amino acid changes to serine, glycine, proline and leucine have not been reported in patients, however, were studied via site-directed mutagenesis and found to result in enzymatic activities ranging from 40-70% of wild-type, which is higher that 20% found for p.(Arg118Cys) (PMID: 23935525). (I) 0808 - Previous reports of pathogenicity for this variant are conflicting. This variant has been reported as a variant of uncertain significance (11x) and likely pathogenic (2x) in ClinVar. In the literature, it has been reported in both male and female patients, where the variant results in residual enzyme activities that is consistent with mild, late onset Fabry disease (PMID: 16773563; 20122163; 30569317; 31291414). However, the pathogenicity of this variant has been called into question by at least one publication by demonstrating that the variant does not segregate with Fabry disease (PMID: 25468652) and in another publication where a different variant in GLA was deemed to be causative of FD the family (PMID:28941980). Lukas et al (2013) refer to this variant's clinical phenotype as being a ""variant phenotype"" (PMID: 23935525). The ""variant phenotype"" is explained by Andrade et al (2008) as having a low level of residual alpha-galactosidase activity that protects patients from developing classic FD, however some patients may present with late onset end-organ failure (PMID: 18003767). (I) 1001 - This variant has strong functional evidence supporting abnormal protein function. Gaspar et al (2010) measured alpha-galactose activity in patient leukocytes and found that the variant conferred a reduction of enzyme activity to 35% of wild-type in 1 hemizygous male and 60%-79% of wild-type in 2 heterozygous females (PMID: 20122163). In vitro functional studies of this variant showed a reduction of enzymatic actiivities ranging between 20-29% in 2 independent studies (PMID: 1677356; 23935525).

42454,Uncertain significance,"Mar 31, 2022","Curated 19/3/2021: Based on the classification scheme VCGS_Germline_v1.3.4, this variant is classified as VUS - 3A. Following criteria are met: 0103 - Dominant negative and loss of function are known mechanisms of disease in this gene and are associated with Fabry disease (MIM#301500). Truncating variants in the last exon have been reported with a dominant negative mechanism, while those predicted to undergo nonsense mediated decay been reported with a loss of function mechanism. Missense variants have been reported with both aforementioned mechanisms. Gain of function has also been suggested, however more evidence is required (PMID: 8878432; PMID: 31613176). (I) 0109 - This gene is associated with X-linked disease. Both males and females have been reported with Fabry disease, though the latter are more rarely reported and tend to have milder disease (OMIM, PMID: 31613176). (I) 0200 - Variant is predicted to result in a missense amino acid change from arginine to cysteine. (I) 0251 - This variant is heterozygous. (I) 0302 - Variant is present in gnomAD (v3) <0.001 for a dominant condition (30 heterozygotes, 1 homozygote, 13 hemizygotes). (SP) 0309 - An alternative amino acid change at the same position has been observed in gnomAD (v3) (4 heterozygotes, 0 homozygotes, 1 hemizygote). (I) 0501 - Missense variant consistently predicted to be damaging by multiple in silico tools or highly conserved with a major amino acid change. (SP) 0600 - Variant is located in the annotated melibiase 2 domain (Pfam). (I) 0701 - Another missense variant comparable to the one identified in this case has inconclusive previous evidence for pathogenicity. p.(Arg118His) has previously been reported as a VUS in at least one publication (PMID 30477121). Alternative amino acid changes to serine, glycine, proline and leucine have not been reported in patients, however, were studied via site-directed mutagenesis and found to result in enzymatic activities ranging from 40-70% of wild-type, which is higher that 20% found for p.(Arg118Cys) (PMID: 23935525). (I) 0808 - Previous reports of pathogenicity for this variant are conflicting. This variant has been reported as a variant of uncertain significance (11x) and likely pathogenic (2x) in ClinVar. In the literature, it has been reported in both male and female patients, where the variant results in residual enzyme activities that is consistent with mild, late onset Fabry disease (PMID: 16773563; 20122163; 30569317; 31291414). However, the pathogenicity of this variant has been called into question by at least one publication by demonstrating that the variant does not segregate with Fabry disease (PMID: 25468652) and in another publication where a different variant in GLA was deemed to be causative of FD the family (PMID:28941980). Lukas et al (2013) refer to this variant's clinical phenotype as being a ""variant phenotype"" (PMID: 23935525). The ""variant phenotype"" is explained by Andrade et al (2008) as having a low level of residual alpha-galactosidase activity that protects patients from developing classic FD, however some patients may present with late onset end-organ failure (PMID: 18003767). (I) 1001 - This variant has strong functional evidence supporting abnormal protein function. Gaspar et al (2010) measured alpha-galactose activity in patient leukocytes and found that the variant conferred a reduction of enzyme activity to 35% of wild-type in 1 hemizygous male and 60%-79% of wild-type in 2 heterozygous females (PMID: 20122163). In vitro functional studies of this variant showed a reduction of enzymatic actiivities ranging between 20-29% in 2 independent studies (PMID: 1677356; 23935525).

42454,Uncertain significance,"Mar 31, 2022","Curated 19/3/2021: Based on the classification scheme VCGS_Germline_v1.3.4, this variant is classified as VUS - 3A. Following criteria are met: 0103 - Dominant negative and loss of function are known mechanisms of disease in this gene and are associated with Fabry disease (MIM#301500). Truncating variants in the last exon have been reported with a dominant negative mechanism, while those predicted to undergo nonsense mediated decay been reported with a loss of function mechanism. Missense variants have been reported with both aforementioned mechanisms. Gain of function has also been suggested, however more evidence is required (PMID: 8878432; PMID: 31613176). (I) 0109 - This gene is associated with X-linked disease. Both males and females have been reported with Fabry disease, though the latter are more rarely reported and tend to have milder disease (OMIM, PMID: 31613176). (I) 0200 - Variant is predicted to result in a missense amino acid change from arginine to cysteine. (I) 0251 - This variant is heterozygous. (I) 0302 - Variant is present in gnomAD (v3) <0.001 for a dominant condition (30 heterozygotes, 1 homozygote, 13 hemizygotes). (SP) 0309 - An alternative amino acid change at the same position has been observed in gnomAD (v3) (4 heterozygotes, 0 homozygotes, 1 hemizygote). (I) 0501 - Missense variant consistently predicted to be damaging by multiple in silico tools or highly conserved with a major amino acid change. (SP) 0600 - Variant is located in the annotated melibiase 2 domain (Pfam). (I) 0701 - Another missense variant comparable to the one identified in this case has inconclusive previous evidence for pathogenicity. p.(Arg118His) has previously been reported as a VUS in at least one publication (PMID 30477121). Alternative amino acid changes to serine, glycine, proline and leucine have not been reported in patients, however, were studied via site-directed mutagenesis and found to result in enzymatic activities ranging from 40-70% of wild-type, which is higher that 20% found for p.(Arg118Cys) (PMID: 23935525). (I) 0808 - Previous reports of pathogenicity for this variant are conflicting. This variant has been reported as a variant of uncertain significance (11x) and likely pathogenic (2x) in ClinVar. In the literature, it has been reported in both male and female patients, where the variant results in residual enzyme activities that is consistent with mild, late onset Fabry disease (PMID: 16773563; 20122163; 30569317; 31291414). However, the pathogenicity of this variant has been called into question by at least one publication by demonstrating that the variant does not segregate with Fabry disease (PMID: 25468652) and in another publication where a different variant in GLA was deemed to be causative of FD the family (PMID:28941980). Lukas et al (2013) refer to this variant's clinical phenotype as being a ""variant phenotype"" (PMID: 23935525). The ""variant phenotype"" is explained by Andrade et al (2008) as having a low level of residual alpha-galactosidase activity that protects patients from developing classic FD, however some patients may present with late onset end-organ failure (PMID: 18003767). (I) 1001 - This variant has strong functional evidence supporting abnormal protein function. Gaspar et al (2010) measured alpha-galactose activity in patient leukocytes and found that the variant conferred a reduction of enzyme activity to 35% of wild-type in 1 hemizygous male and 60%-79% of wild-type in 2 heterozygous females (PMID: 20122163).

Alternative amino acid changes to serine, glycine, proline and leucine have not been reported in patients, however, were studied via site-directed mutagenesis and found to result in enzymatic activities ranging from 40-70% of wild-type, which is higher that 20% found for p.(Arg118Cys) (PMID: 23935525). (I) 0808 - Previous reports of pathogenicity for this variant are conflicting. This variant has been reported as a variant of uncertain significance (11x) and likely pathogenic (2x) in ClinVar. In the literature, it has been reported in both male and female patients, where the variant results in residual enzyme activities that is consistent with mild, late onset Fabry disease (PMID: 16773563; 20122163; 30569317; 31291414). However, the pathogenicity of this variant has been called into question by at least one publication by demonstrating that the variant does not segregate with Fabry disease (PMID: 25468652) and in another publication where a different variant in GLA was deemed to be causative of FD the family (PMID:28941980). Lukas et al (2013) refer to this variant's clinical phenotype as being a ""variant phenotype"" (PMID: 23935525). The ""variant phenotype"" is explained by Andrade et al (2008) as having a low level of residual alpha-galactosidase activity that protects patients from developing classic FD, however some patients may present with late onset end-organ failure (PMID: 18003767). (I) 1001 - This variant has strong functional evidence supporting abnormal protein function. Gaspar et al (2010) measured alpha-galactose activity in patient leukocytes and found that the variant conferred a reduction of enzyme activity to 35% of wild-type in 1 hemizygous male and 60%-79% of wild-type in 2 heterozygous females (PMID: 20122163).

(I) 0808 - Previous reports of pathogenicity for this variant are conflicting. This variant has been reported as a variant of uncertain significance (11x) and likely pathogenic (2x) in ClinVar.

However, the pathogenicity of this variant has been called into question by at least one publication by demonstrating that the variant does not segregate with Fabry disease (PMID: 25468652) and in another publication where a different variant in GLA was deemed to be causative of FD the family (PMID:28941980). Lukas et al (2013) refer to this variant's clinical phenotype as being a ""variant phenotype"" (PMID: 23935525). The ""variant phenotype"" is explained by Andrade et al (2008) as having a low level of residual alpha-galactosidase activity that protects patients from developing classic FD, however some patients may present with late onset end-organ failure (PMID: 18003767).

In the literature, it has been reported in both male and female patients, where the variant results in residual enzyme activities that is consistent with mild, late onset Fabry disease (PMID: 16773563; 20122163; 30569317; 31291414). However, the pathogenicity of this variant has been called into question by at least one publication by demonstrating that the variant does not segregate with Fabry disease (PMID: 25468652) and in another publication where a different variant in GLA was deemed to be causative of FD the family (PMID:28941980). Lukas et al (2013) refer to this variant's clinical phenotype as being a ""variant phenotype"" (PMID: 23935525). The ""variant phenotype"" is explained by Andrade et al (2008) as having a low level of residual alpha-galactosidase activity that protects patients from developing classic FD, however some patients may present with late onset end-organ failure (PMID: 18003767). (I) 1001 - This variant has strong functional evidence supporting abnormal protein function. Gaspar et al (2010) measured alpha-galactose activity in patient leukocytes and found that the variant conferred a reduction of enzyme activity to 35% of wild-type in 1 hemizygous male and 60%-79% of wild-type in 2 heterozygous females (PMID: 20122163).

42454,Uncertain significance,"Sep 05, 2023","Variant summary: GLA c.352C>T (p.Arg118Cys) results in a non-conservative amino acid change in the encoded protein sequence. Four of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.00023 in 184752 control chromosomes. This frequency is not significantly higher than estimated for a pathogenic variant in GLA causing Fabry Disease (0.00023 vs 0.005). However, the finding of 17 hemizygous occurrences in gnomAD may be evidence against pathogenicity, although the possibility of reduced penetrance and/or subclinical cases cannot be ruled out. This variant has been found in patients predominantly of Portuguese or Spanish ancestry, with clinical features ranging from no symptoms to acute cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, kidney diseases, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (e.g. Morais_2008, Baptista_2010, Gaspar_2010, Valbuena_2012, Rolfs _2013, Caetano_2014, Golbus_2014, Alharbi_2019, Varela_2020, Delarosa-Rodriguez_2021). In patients (harboring this variant) who presented with cardiological manifestations that are shared by Fabry disease (FD) as well as other independent cardiac phenotypes (such as DCM), a deleterious variant was also found (TPM1 D230N; Golbus_2014). Additionally, this variant has been reported in patients who did not meet clinical criteria for FD (e.g. Morais_2008, Kilarski_2015, de Greef_2016, Nowak_2019, Azevedo_2020, Stiles_2020). Furthermore, Ferreira et al (2015) reviewed the clinical, biochemical and histopathology data obtained from 22 individuals of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry carrying the R118C allele and concluded that the variant did not segregate with FD clinical phenotypes in a Mendelian fashion, but might be a modulator of the multifactorial risk of cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, co-occurrence of the variant in cis with a pathogenic variant (GLA deletion of exons 3 and 4) was reported in a multi-generational family affected with Fabry Disease, providing supporting evidence for a benign role (Barbeito-Caamano_2018). Although in vitro studies strongly suggest decreased enzymatic activity associated with this variant (Lukas_2013, Spada_2006), enzymatic evaluation in patients' blood or plasma varied from reduced enzymatic level to normal levels.

42454,Uncertain significance,"Sep 05, 2023","Variant summary: GLA c.352C>T (p.Arg118Cys) results in a non-conservative amino acid change in the encoded protein sequence. Four of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.00023 in 184752 control chromosomes. This frequency is not significantly higher than estimated for a pathogenic variant in GLA causing Fabry Disease (0.00023 vs 0.005). However, the finding of 17 hemizygous occurrences in gnomAD may be evidence against pathogenicity, although the possibility of reduced penetrance and/or subclinical cases cannot be ruled out. This variant has been found in patients predominantly of Portuguese or Spanish ancestry, with clinical features ranging from no symptoms to acute cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, kidney diseases, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (e.g. Morais_2008, Baptista_2010, Gaspar_2010, Valbuena_2012, Rolfs _2013, Caetano_2014, Golbus_2014, Alharbi_2019, Varela_2020, Delarosa-Rodriguez_2021). In patients (harboring this variant) who presented with cardiological manifestations that are shared by Fabry disease (FD) as well as other independent cardiac phenotypes (such as DCM), a deleterious variant was also found (TPM1 D230N; Golbus_2014). Additionally, this variant has been reported in patients who did not meet clinical criteria for FD (e.g. Morais_2008, Kilarski_2015, de Greef_2016, Nowak_2019, Azevedo_2020, Stiles_2020). Furthermore, Ferreira et al (2015) reviewed the clinical, biochemical and histopathology data obtained from 22 individuals of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry carrying the R118C allele and concluded that the variant did not segregate with FD clinical phenotypes in a Mendelian fashion, but might be a modulator of the multifactorial risk of cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, co-occurrence of the variant in cis with a pathogenic variant (GLA deletion of exons 3 and 4) was reported in a multi-generational family affected with Fabry Disease, providing supporting evidence for a benign role (Barbeito-Caamano_2018).

Furthermore, Ferreira et al (2015) reviewed the clinical, biochemical and histopathology data obtained from 22 individuals of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry carrying the R118C allele and concluded that the variant did not segregate with FD clinical phenotypes in a Mendelian fashion, but might be a modulator of the multifactorial risk of cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, co-occurrence of the variant in cis with a pathogenic variant (GLA deletion of exons 3 and 4) was reported in a multi-generational family affected with Fabry Disease, providing supporting evidence for a benign role (Barbeito-Caamano_2018).

42454,Uncertain significance,"Sep 05, 2023","Variant summary: GLA c.352C>T (p.Arg118Cys) results in a non-conservative amino acid change in the encoded protein sequence. Four of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.00023 in 184752 control chromosomes. This frequency is not significantly higher than estimated for a pathogenic variant in GLA causing Fabry Disease (0.00023 vs 0.005). However, the finding of 17 hemizygous occurrences in gnomAD may be evidence against pathogenicity, although the possibility of reduced penetrance and/or subclinical cases cannot be ruled out. This variant has been found in patients predominantly of Portuguese or Spanish ancestry, with clinical features ranging from no symptoms to acute cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, kidney diseases, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (e.g. Morais_2008, Baptista_2010, Gaspar_2010, Valbuena_2012, Rolfs _2013, Caetano_2014, Golbus_2014, Alharbi_2019, Varela_2020, Delarosa-Rodriguez_2021). In patients (harboring this variant) who presented with cardiological manifestations that are shared by Fabry disease (FD) as well as other independent cardiac phenotypes (such as DCM), a deleterious variant was also found (TPM1 D230N; Golbus_2014). Additionally, this variant has been reported in patients who did not meet clinical criteria for FD (e.g. Morais_2008, Kilarski_2015, de Greef_2016, Nowak_2019, Azevedo_2020, Stiles_2020). Furthermore, Ferreira et al (2015) reviewed the clinical, biochemical and histopathology data obtained from 22 individuals of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry carrying the R118C allele and concluded that the variant did not segregate with FD clinical phenotypes in a Mendelian fashion, but might be a modulator of the multifactorial risk of cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, co-occurrence of the variant in cis with a pathogenic variant (GLA deletion of exons 3 and 4) was reported in a multi-generational family affected with Fabry Disease, providing supporting evidence for a benign role (Barbeito-Caamano_2018).

This variant has been found in patients predominantly of Portuguese or Spanish ancestry, with clinical features ranging from no symptoms to acute cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, kidney diseases, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (e.g. Morais_2008, Baptista_2010, Gaspar_2010, Valbuena_2012, Rolfs _2013, Caetano_2014, Golbus_2014, Alharbi_2019, Varela_2020, Delarosa-Rodriguez_2021). In patients (harboring this variant) who presented with cardiological manifestations that are shared by Fabry disease (FD) as well as other independent cardiac phenotypes (such as DCM), a deleterious variant was also found (TPM1 D230N; Golbus_2014). Additionally, this variant has been reported in patients who did not meet clinical criteria for FD (e.g. Morais_2008, Kilarski_2015, de Greef_2016, Nowak_2019, Azevedo_2020, Stiles_2020). Furthermore, Ferreira et al (2015) reviewed the clinical, biochemical and histopathology data obtained from 22 individuals of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry carrying the R118C allele and concluded that the variant did not segregate with FD clinical phenotypes in a Mendelian fashion, but might be a modulator of the multifactorial risk of cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, co-occurrence of the variant in cis with a pathogenic variant (GLA deletion of exons 3 and 4) was reported in a multi-generational family affected with Fabry Disease, providing supporting evidence for a benign role (Barbeito-Caamano_2018). Although in vitro studies strongly suggest decreased enzymatic activity associated with this variant (Lukas_2013, Spada_2006), enzymatic evaluation in patients' blood or plasma varied from reduced enzymatic level to normal levels.

42454,Uncertain significance,"Sep 05, 2023","Variant summary: GLA c.352C>T (p.Arg118Cys) results in a non-conservative amino acid change in the encoded protein sequence. Four of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.00023 in 184752 control chromosomes. This frequency is not significantly higher than estimated for a pathogenic variant in GLA causing Fabry Disease (0.00023 vs 0.005). However, the finding of 17 hemizygous occurrences in gnomAD may be evidence against pathogenicity, although the possibility of reduced penetrance and/or subclinical cases cannot be ruled out. This variant has been found in patients predominantly of Portuguese or Spanish ancestry, with clinical features ranging from no symptoms to acute cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, kidney diseases, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (e.g. Morais_2008, Baptista_2010, Gaspar_2010, Valbuena_2012, Rolfs _2013, Caetano_2014, Golbus_2014, Alharbi_2019, Varela_2020, Delarosa-Rodriguez_2021). In patients (harboring this variant) who presented with cardiological manifestations that are shared by Fabry disease (FD) as well as other independent cardiac phenotypes (such as DCM), a deleterious variant was also found (TPM1 D230N; Golbus_2014). Additionally, this variant has been reported in patients who did not meet clinical criteria for FD (e.g. Morais_2008, Kilarski_2015, de Greef_2016, Nowak_2019, Azevedo_2020, Stiles_2020). Furthermore, Ferreira et al (2015) reviewed the clinical, biochemical and histopathology data obtained from 22 individuals of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry carrying the R118C allele and concluded that the variant did not segregate with FD clinical phenotypes in a Mendelian fashion, but might be a modulator of the multifactorial risk of cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, co-occurrence of the variant in cis with a pathogenic variant (GLA deletion of exons 3 and 4) was reported in a multi-generational family affected with Fabry Disease, providing supporting evidence for a benign role (Barbeito-Caamano_2018).

This variant has been found in patients predominantly of Portuguese or Spanish ancestry, with clinical features ranging from no symptoms to acute cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, kidney diseases, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (e.g. Morais_2008, Baptista_2010, Gaspar_2010, Valbuena_2012, Rolfs _2013, Caetano_2014, Golbus_2014, Alharbi_2019, Varela_2020, Delarosa-Rodriguez_2021). In patients (harboring this variant) who presented with cardiological manifestations that are shared by Fabry disease (FD) as well as other independent cardiac phenotypes (such as DCM), a deleterious variant was also found (TPM1 D230N; Golbus_2014). Additionally, this variant has been reported in patients who did not meet clinical criteria for FD (e.g. Morais_2008, Kilarski_2015, de Greef_2016, Nowak_2019, Azevedo_2020, Stiles_2020). Furthermore, Ferreira et al (2015) reviewed the clinical, biochemical and histopathology data obtained from 22 individuals of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry carrying the R118C allele and concluded that the variant did not segregate with FD clinical phenotypes in a Mendelian fashion, but might be a modulator of the multifactorial risk of cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, co-occurrence of the variant in cis with a pathogenic variant (GLA deletion of exons 3 and 4) was reported in a multi-generational family affected with Fabry Disease, providing supporting evidence for a benign role (Barbeito-Caamano_2018). Although in vitro studies strongly suggest decreased enzymatic activity associated with this variant (Lukas_2013, Spada_2006), enzymatic evaluation in patients' blood or plasma varied from reduced enzymatic level to normal levels. Multiple submitters have cited clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 with conflicting assessments. The majority of submitters classified the variant as VUS (n=17), and others classified it as either likely pathogenic (n=2) or likely benign (n=2).

The p.Arg118Cys variant in GLA has been reported in 11 individuals with classic or late-onset Fabry disease and segregated with disease in at least 2 affected family members. This variant has also been identified in at least 2 individuals with reduced a-galactosidase activity, 6 individuals who had stroke, 1 individual who had MI, 1 individual with small fiber neuropathy, 1 individual with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 4 individuals with LVH, 1 child with HCM, 2 infants with RCM and DCM, and 3 individuals with other phenotypes (Spada 2006, Gaspar 2010, Baptista 2010, Kiesling 2014, Genoni 2011, Morais 2008, Elliott 2011, Turaca 2012, Caetano 2014, Pasqualim 2014, Colon 2017, Barajas-Colon 2017, de Greef 2016, Goncalves 2017, Kilarski 2015, Schiffmann 2017, Samuelsson 2014, Ferreira 2015).
